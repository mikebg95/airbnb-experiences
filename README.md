This app was made as part of the beginners/intermediate Scrimba React course. The app is a clone of the Airbnb Experiences page.


The goals of the app were to:

(1) get familiar with basic React concepts like passing and destructuring props, children, and reusable components
(2) practic implementing SCSS based on Figma designs
(3) get familiar with continous deployment on Netlify through Github.
